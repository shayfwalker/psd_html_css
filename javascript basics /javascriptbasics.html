				<p><u>Variable Declaration</u>Javascript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coddee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be indentified with unique names. Those unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span></p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><u>Varible Assignment</u> Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables- our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hol. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>varx = 10;</span></p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><u>Data Types</u> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need toknow the data type. There are six data types that are Javascript primitives; Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1,'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_nameL 'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><u>Conditionals</u> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions- hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code; </p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><u>Loops</u> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine youhave to run a mile, well you run around the track fourtimes and then you stop. Thats a loop!</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><u>Function</u> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code bloack. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a deak from Ikea, we open up the insturction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished out instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</p>
